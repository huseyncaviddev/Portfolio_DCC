**Design Movement**: Neo-Brutalism / High-Tech Industrial
**Core Principles**:
1.  **Raw Functionality**: The design should feel like a powerful tool, not just a brochure.
2.  **Transparency**: Expose the "grid" and structure of the layout, symbolizing the transparent nature of good IT management.
3.  **High Contrast**: Use stark contrasts to guide attention immediately to critical alerts or actions.
4.  **Monospace Typography**: Evoke the feeling of a terminal or code editor, reinforcing technical expertise.

**Color Philosophy**:
-   **Primary**: Electric Blue (#0047FF) - Represents pure digital energy and connectivity.
-   **Background**: Off-White / Light Grey (#F0F0F0) - A neutral canvas that makes the content pop, avoiding the "dark mode default" of tech sites.
-   **Accents**: Warning Yellow (#FFD600) and Error Red (#FF3B30) - Used sparingly for "status" indicators or urgent calls to action.
-   **Intent**: To convey a sense of directness, efficiency, and "no-nonsense" technical capability.

**Layout Paradigm**:
-   **Modular / Card-Based**: Content is compartmentalized into distinct "blocks" or "modules" with visible thick borders.
-   **Asymmetric Grids**: Avoid perfect symmetry; use staggered layouts to create dynamic tension and interest.
-   **Sticky Elements**: Navigation or key CTAs that stick to the viewport edges, resembling toolbars in software applications.

**Signature Elements**:
1.  **Visible Borders**: Thick, black (or dark grey) borders around all containers.
2.  **Drop Shadows**: Hard, non-blurred drop shadows (offset 4px, no blur) to create a tactile, "stacked" feel.
3.  **Technical Iconography**: Icons that look like system tray icons or schematic symbols rather than illustrative graphics.

**Interaction Philosophy**:
-   **Immediate Feedback**: Buttons should have a distinct "pressed" state (moving down 2px) rather than just a color change.
-   **Hover Effects**: Elements might invert colors or reveal additional technical data on hover (e.g., a "scan" effect).

**Animation**:
-   **Snappy & Linear**: Animations should be fast (150ms) and linear, avoiding ease-in-out curves to feel more robotic and precise.
-   **Glitch Effects**: Subtle glitch effects on hover or page load for headers to emphasize the "digital" nature.

**Typography System**:
-   **Headings**: 'Space Mono' or 'JetBrains Mono' (Bold, Uppercase) - For a command-line aesthetic.
-   **Body**: 'Inter' or 'Roboto' (Regular) - For high readability of service descriptions.

**Design Movement**: Glassmorphism / Ethereal Future
**Core Principles**:
1.  **Depth & Layering**: Use translucency to create a sense of depth, implying a complex system working beneath the surface.
2.  **Soft Light**: Simulate a glowing, ambient environment, suggesting safety and protection (key for security services).
3.  **Fluidity**: Elements should feel weightless and smooth, representing the seamless flow of data.
4.  **Minimalism**: Strip away heavy borders and solid containers; let content float.

**Color Philosophy**:
-   **Primary**: Cyan / Teal Gradient (Linear gradient from #00F0FF to #0077FF) - Evokes a futuristic, clean, and cooling sensation (like a well-cooled server room).
-   **Background**: Deep Navy / Midnight Blue (#050A14) - Represents the depth of the digital space.
-   **Accents**: Neon Purple (#BC13FE) - For highlighting premium or "magic" automated features.
-   **Intent**: To make IT management feel effortless, modern, and almost magical.

**Layout Paradigm**:
-   **Floating Containers**: Content lives on semi-transparent "glass" cards that float above the background.
-   **Centralized Focus with Orbital Elements**: Key messages are central, with decorative elements "orbiting" or floating around them.
-   **Z-Axis Navigation**: Use depth (blur, scale) to indicate hierarchy rather than just size or position.

**Signature Elements**:
1.  **Frosted Glass**: Background blur (backdrop-filter: blur(10px)) on cards and navigation.
2.  **Glowing Orbs**: Soft, colored gradients in the background that move slowly, creating a "living" backdrop.
3.  **Thin, glowing borders**: 1px borders with a slight gradient to define edges without heaviness.

**Interaction Philosophy**:
-   **Soft Glows**: Hovering over elements causes them to glow or brighten, like waking up a screen.
-   **Parallax**: Mouse movement causes background layers to move at different speeds, enhancing the 3D effect.

**Animation**:
-   **Slow & Fluid**: Animations are slow (500ms+) and use ease-in-out curves to feel organic and liquid.
-   **Fade & Scale**: Elements gently fade in and scale up, rather than sliding in abruptly.

**Typography System**:
-   **Headings**: 'Outfit' or 'Plus Jakarta Sans' (Bold, Tracking-tight) - Modern, geometric sans-serifs.
-   **Body**: 'DM Sans' - Clean and approachable.

**Design Movement**: Swiss Style / International Typographic Style (Digital Adaptation)
**Core Principles**:
1.  **Grid Systems**: A strict, mathematical grid governs all placement, conveying order, reliability, and precision.
2.  **Objective Photography**: Use high-quality, realistic photography of hardware/servers rather than abstract illustrations.
3.  **Asymmetry**: Use asymmetric layouts to create dynamic balance and guide the eye.
4.  **Typography as Image**: Large, bold typography is the primary visual element.

**Color Philosophy**:
-   **Primary**: Swiss Red (#FF3333) - Bold, confident, and attention-grabbing (classic Swiss style).
-   **Background**: Stark White (#FFFFFF) - Maximum contrast and cleanliness.
-   **Text**: Pitch Black (#000000) - For ultimate legibility and authority.
-   **Accents**: Cool Grey (#888888) - For secondary information.
-   **Intent**: To communicate absolute professionalism, reliability, and structural integrity.

**Layout Paradigm**:
-   **Strict Grid**: A visible or implied 12-column grid. Content aligns perfectly to grid lines.
-   **Negative Space**: Extensive use of white space to separate sections and focus attention.
-   **Horizontal Rhythm**: Strong horizontal lines separating sections.

**Signature Elements**:
1.  **Big Bold Type**: Headlines are massive and often break the grid or span multiple columns.
2.  **Rule Lines**: Thin black lines separating content blocks.
3.  **Micro-interactions**: Subtle, precise movements.

**Interaction Philosophy**:
-   **Snap & Align**: Elements might "snap" into place.
-   **Underline Animations**: Links have thick, animated underlines.

**Animation**:
-   **Precise & Staggered**: Elements reveal themselves in a staggered sequence along the grid lines.
-   **Masking**: Images or text reveal by sliding out from behind a mask.

**Typography System**:
-   **Headings**: 'Helvetica Now' or 'Inter' (Black/Heavy weight) - The quintessential Swiss font.
-   **Body**: 'Inter' (Regular) - Neutral and legible.
